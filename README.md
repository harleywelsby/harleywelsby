## Hi, I'm Harley!

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer based in New Zealand.
  
I'm passionate about designing and developing web applications with React.js and .NET, but I also like to build TypeScript Discord Bots, Unity Video Games and everything in-between.  
  
You can find some of my work on my [Website](https://www.harleywelsby.dev/) or the GitHub page for my latest Discord bot, [Robo-Moe](https://github.com/harleywelsby/RoboMoe)!

I'm always looking to meet people and love to engage with the Engineering and Computer Science community, so feel free to reach out to me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harleywelsby/).
